# Installation
## New Sandbox Application
Spree includes a helpful Rake task for setting up a sample application:
* Clone the Git repo
```shell
git clone git://github.com/spree/spree.git && cd spree
```
* Install the gem dependencies
```shell
bundle install
```
* Create a sandbox application for testing purposes (and automatically perform all necessary database setup)
```shell
bundle exec rake sandbox
```
* Start the server
```shell
cd sandbox && rails server
```

This creates a barebones application configured with Spree gem. It runs the DB migrations  and sets
up the sample data. Resulting `sandbox` folder is ignored by `.gitignore` and is  deleted and
rebuilt from scratch each time the Rake task runs.

## Existing Application
* To use a stable branch of Spree, add this line to your Gemfile
```
gem 'spree', github: 'spree/spree', branch: '3-0-stable'
```
* To use the bleeding edge version of Spree:
```
gem 'spree', github: 'spree/spree'
```
* Install these gems using this command:
```shell
bundle install --auto-accept
```
* Use the install generator to set up Spree:
```shell
rails g spree:install --sample=false --seed=false
```
* You can avoid running DB migrations and or generating seed and sample data by passing these flags:
```shell
rails g spree:install --migrate=false --sample=false --seed=false
```
* To perform those on your own:
```shell
bundle exec rake railties:install:migrations
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed
bundle exec rake spree_sample:load
```

#### Browse Store
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### Browse Admin Interface
[http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)

Username `spree@example.com` and password `spree123`

> If you elected not to use the `--auto-accept` option when you added Spree to your Rails app, and 
did not install the seed data, the admin user will not yet exist in your database. You can run a 
simple rake task to create a new admin user.

> ```bash
> rake spree_auth:admin:create
> ```

## Performance Tips
Rails in development mode continuously reloads objects on each request. The asset pipeline made 
things worse. To speed up performance in development mode when NOT working on front end issues:
* In your `config/development.rb` add:
```
config.assets.debug = false
```
* Precompile your assets:
```
RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rake assets:precompile
```
* To remove precompiled assets (especially before committing to Git):
```
RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rake assets:clean
```

## Upgrades
The core files are encapsulated separately from sandbox so upgrading to newer files will not 
override nor replace sandbox's customized files. To upgrade:
* Ensure the installed spree gem is up-to-date by modifying `Gemfile` to match the new 
spree version
* Run `bundle update spree`
* Copy any DB migrations from Spree (and any other engine) and run them:
```
    rake railties:install:migrations
    rake db:migrate
```
* If you have extensions, you will need to manually verify that each works once an upgrade is 
complete. Typically, compatible extensions will in a branch matching the upgrade version
* Manually test your store
