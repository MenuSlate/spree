# Getting Help

## Mailing List
- First place to seek help is [Google Groups mailing
- list]([http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user](http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user)) where Spree community answer questions, or in some
- cases, a Spree employee does so
- This list is perfect for _general_ questions about Spree. For bugs see GitHub Issues below
- Questions on this list may take some time to answer

## Gitter
- Spree has a [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/spree/spree) similar to IRC that
- can be used to discuss Spree in real-time.
- We prefer Gitter over IRC.

## IRC Channel
- IRC channel for Spree is at #spree on irc.freenode.net
- Here you can talk to other users of Spree in real-time
- Spree employees are represented in the channel with a `@` before their name on most clients

## GitHub Issues
[GitHub issues page for Spree](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues) shows a list of currently open issues on Spree
- If you think you found a new issue first read [Filing an Issue]
