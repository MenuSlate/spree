## Taxon (Model)

### Fields
* Name: A required field for all taxons. The name determines what the user will see when they
look at this product in your store.
* Permalink: The end of the URL a user goes to, in order to see all products associated 
with this taxon. This field is also required, and a value is automatically generated for you 
when you create the taxon. Be careful with arbitrarily changing the permalink - if you have two 
taxons with the same permalink you will run into issues.
* Icon: This option is currently not functional.
* Meta Title: Overrides the store's setting for page title when a user visits the taxon's 
page on the front end of the website.
* Meta Description: Overrides the store's setting for meta description when a user visits 
the taxon's page on the front end of the website.
* Meta Keywords: Overrides the store's setting for meta keywords when a user visits the 
taxon's page on the front end of the website.
* Description: This option is currently not functional.
